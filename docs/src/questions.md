# Some other questions about `Express`

## What is the difference between `Express` and `express`?

`express` is the workflow framework's name, while `Express` is the short form of
`Express.jl`, the Julia implementation of `express`. We do not want the project's name
linked to a specific programming language: who says we cannot have a Python version of
`express` in the future?

## Why do you use Julia, why not use...?

The same as the Julia's "we are greedy" speech:

> We are greedy: we want more.
>
> We want a language that's open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with
> the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that's homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp,
> but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable
> for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string
> processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs
> together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious
> hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

To summarize,
- we want the code as easy to read/write as Python, but as fast as C;
- we want the code as extensible as possible;
- we want the flourishing ecosystem of Julia, dedicated to and developed by the scientific community itself.
